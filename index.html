            Kohei Horikoshi was born in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. At a
            young age, he developed a fascination with the fine arts, and drew
            frequently in his spare time. After high school, he attended Nagoya
            University of Arts, where he practiced drawing manga outside of the
            classroom, knowing that his ultimate goal was to become a successful
            mangaka.
          </p>
          <p>
            His first job in manga was as an assistant to Yasuki Tanaka, writer
            of the popular manga “Summer Time Rendering.” In 2007, he earned a
            one-off spot for his manga to be featured in Shonen Jump, a
            widely-read manga anthology and magazine. Eventually, he was able to
            publish his first long form manga in 2010, called “Oumagadoki Zoo.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He has written three different manga series, with the most
            well-known of the three being a series called “My Hero Academia.”
            This manga has is among the most popular manga of the 2010s, and has
            spawned numerous spin-offs in the form of tv shows, movies, and
            video games. It is based in a world where almost everyone has a
            special power, known as a “Quirk.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Horikoshi has stated that his work is influenced by the manga he
            read as a child, as well as Marvel comics.

              In <i>The Importance of the Act of Reading</i>, Freire (1983)
              explains that “Reading does not consist merely of decoding the
              written word or language; rather, it is preceded by and
              intertwined with knowledge of the world” (p. 1). It is interesting
              to consider how this applies to fantasy literature such as
              <i>My Hero Academia</i>, where a lot of the super-powered
              characters and events in the manga do not coincide with the
              real-life experience of its readers. One way that Horikoshi works
              to make <i>My Hero Academia</i> more relatable to young people’s
              lives is by placing some of the events of the book in a classroom
              context. For example, in order to achieve his dream of becoming a
              professional superhero, the main character must first graduate
              from a hero academy (as the title implies). This parallels the
              experiences of Horikoshi’s young readers, for whom success in
              school is often also a prerequisite for achieving their dreams.
              This is important for student’s engagement levels with
              <i>My Hero Academia</i>, because “one of the most common ways
              students interact with texts is by making personal connections
              with them” (Carillo, 2017, p. 1). Looking at other fantasy novels
              written for young people, one is able to see a similar technique
              used to great effect. For example, in the
              <i>Harry Potter</i> series, Rowling situated a world of spells and
              magical creatures inside the familiar academic context of a school
              called Hogwarts.

              Manga is a very fast-paced genre of literature. Its graphic nature
              allows authors to show their readers action much faster than if
              they had to describe that action verbally. This is what makes good
              manga so engaging, but it comes with its dangers as well. Thiong’o
              (1993), while reflecting on a certain category of book he read
              when he was young, cautioned that “it was the strong action that
              made one forget, or swallow, all the racist epithets of the
              narratives.” I do not believe that Horishoki’s work is comparable
              to the colonial narratives found in the books that Thiong’o was
              referencing, but it is still important to consider what harmful
              beliefs the engaging plots may be hiding. Horikoshi grew up in
              Japan, which is a largely monoethnic country, and the ethnic
              makeup of his characters reflects this lack of diversity. What are
              the implications of bringing a book formed in a very racially
              homogenous environment into an environment with more diversity,
              such as an American public school? Questions like these would be
              important to discuss when providing Horikoshi’s work to students.

              Critics of manga might claim that its graphic nature and fast-pace
              leads to a mindless reading experience, in which students are
              entertained, but not learning all that much. It is true that manga
              and comic books are not the most challenging reads, but maybe that
              isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, for students who struggle
              to understand what they're reading, combining words and images is
              a great way to increase comprehension (Carter, 2008). Furthermore,
              including popular culture texts like comics or manga in classroom
              instruction can help to motivate reluctant readers (Hong Xu,
              2008).

          </div>
          <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem" class="work-summary">
            In many fantasy novels written for youth, the main character is some
            sort of “Chosen One,” destined from birth to save the world in one
            way or another. One example of this is the popular Percy Jackson
            series, in which there is a famous prophecy predicting how and when
            Percy will save the day. In My Hero Academia, Horikoshi rejects this
            familiar “Chosen One” trope, and writes his main character as one of
            the few people who do not have a special “quirk” or power. Instead,
            it is Izuku’s dedication and persistence, along with some luck along
            the way, that allow him to be successful. This is a valuable
            departure from a common trope, because it emphasizes how your
            actions and circumstances may impact your path in life, rather than
            forwarding the idea of destiny or pre-determination.

            Social Media and Public Image in <i>My Hero Academia</i>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-top: 0.5rem" class="work-summary">
            In <i>My Hero Academia</i>, Horikoshi invites his readers to think
            about aspects of social media and public image in modern society.
            The best example of this is the hero “All Might,” who ends up
            transferring his power to the main character, Izuku. “All Might”
            gained popularity with the public due to his enormous power.
            However, several years before the events of <i>My Hero Academia</i>,
            he suffered an injury to his stomach that made him unable to eat
            enough food. Because of this, he only has the energy to perform hero
            work a few hours a day, and his body has become scrawny and weak. In
            order to maintain his image of invincibility, he hides his true form
            during his hero work, projecting the appearance of strength for as
            long as he can manage. In his first encounter with Izuku, All Might
            claims he hides his weakness because “a symbol of peace who saves
            people with a smile must never be daunted by evil” (Vol. 1, p. 40).
            In other words, he has to keep his public image in line with what
            his fans believe he represents, instead of showing them his honest
            self. This is an interesting dynamic to consider in the social-media
            era, where we decide every day what parts of ourselves we want to
            expose to the internet, and what parts should remain private. It
            also relates to the issue of people comparing their real selves with
            the idealized versions of celebrities they see online, in the same
            way that All Might’s fans might assume he doesn’t have the same
            problems as them, when in reality he is not as fearless as his
            public image might imply.
