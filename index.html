        Kohei Horikoshi was born in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. He developed
        a fascination with the fine arts from a young age, and began drawing
        when he was a small child. After high school he attended Nagoya
        University of Arts, where he frequently practiced the craft of manga
        creation outside of the classroom, knowing that his ultimate goal was to
        become a successful mangaka. His first job in manga was as an assistant
        to Yasuki Tanaka, writer of the popular manga “Summer Time Rendering.”
        In 2007, he earned a one-off spot in Shonen Jump, a widely-read manga
        anthology and magazine. Eventually, he was able to publish his first
        serialized manga in 2010, “Oumagadoki Zoo.” He has written three
        different manga series, with the most well-known of the three being a
        series called “My Hero Academia.” This manga has been one of the most
        popular mangas of the last decade, spawning numerous spin-offs in the
        form of tv shows, movies, and video games. It is based in a world where
        almost everyone has a special power, known as a “Quirk.” Horikoshi has
        stated that his work is influenced by the manga he read as a child, as
        well as the superhero comics produced by Marvel.

          This manga is centered around a teenage girl Hana Anoi, who has just
          started her new job at a Zoo. Pretty soon, she realizes that there is
          something a bit different about this particular zoo. The zoo director,
          Shina, was cursed by the ghost of a rabbit he killed. He must gather
          and care for every animal in the world in order to reverse the curse.
          After realizing this, Hana begins to help Shina in his quest, and her
          comprehensive knowledge of animals proves to be invaluable.
